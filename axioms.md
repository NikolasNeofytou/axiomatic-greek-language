# Initial Axioms and Theorems for Greek

## Axioms
1. **Alphabet**: The Greek alphabet consists of 24 distinct letters.
2. **Word Formation**: Every Greek word has a stem with optional prefixes and suffixes.
3. **Noun Morphology**: Nouns inflect for gender, number, and case via their endings.
4. **Verb Morphology**: Finite verbs inflect for person, number, tense, mood, and voice.
5. **Clause Structure**: Every independent clause contains at least one finite verb.

## Theorems
1. **Verb Identification**: From Axiom 4, each finite verb form uniquely determines its person and number.
2. **Minimal Sentence**: By Axioms 3 and 5, a Greek sentence can consist solely of a finite verb with an implied subject.

Further axioms and theorems will be added as the project progresses.
